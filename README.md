# Farming.ly 
Farming.ly is a Smart Agriculture Monitoring System, proposed here will use the domain of IoT to help farmer
plan an irrigation time table for his farm via a profile which can be edited as consistent with
their necessities and to manage the issues of increased urban population.

The collected data provides the information about different environmental factors which in
turn helps to monitor the system which is useful in monitoring the field data as well as
controlling the field operations which provides the flexibility. The automated system
facilitates farmers for better farming, increasing the yield of crops and contribute to the
conservation of environment.

# Components of the system

1. Wireless Sensor Net:- A wireless network of sensors deployed in the field which collect data

2. Gateway Node:- Collects data from the Wireless Sensor Net and pushes data to the real-time database and also sends notification in form of email


3. Real-Time Database:- Holds data. Firebase is used here to implemenet real-time database

4. Android App:- It displays the real-time data

* I have also included a web page that displays data. 
# PS

Please do read the Weekly Development reports that I have included because they offer a detailed explanation of each module.
